I was unsure of whether my output for the towers() commands was correct however for the questions below, my answers seemed to work when I inputted (towers 5 2 3) instead of towers (5, 2, 3). For the last question, the number of moves was specified in my output, so I did not copy and paste the file elsewhere to count the number of lines.

QUESTION ANSWERS

1) The first recursive call will be: towers(4, 2, 1)

2) There will be 4 recursive calls before the first recursive call returns the initial invocation.

3) The move that will be made is '2 3'.

4) The second recursive call would be towers (3, 2, 3).

EXTRA PROBLEM: if towers (8, 1, 2) was invoked, 255 lines would be printed.
